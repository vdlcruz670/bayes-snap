## Description
Using data from R's Tidycensus package, we created visuals to explore the relationships between SNAP participation and other socioeconomic variables at the census tract level. We utilized a linear regression model to analyze the correlation between SNAP % and our chosen predictors.

## Data
The dataset for this project includes:

Geography: Census tracts in Hawaii (state FIPS code 15).

Variables:
SNAP Rate: Households receiving SNAP.
Total Households.
Median Income.
Employment Rate.
Poverty Rate: Families below the poverty level.
Education Rate: High school graduates and above.

Data is collected using the tidycensus R package.

## Code
The project relies on the following R libraries:

Data Manipulation and Cleaning: tidyverse, dplyr, janitor, naniar.

Bayesian Modeling: brms, rstanarm, bayesrules, bayesplot.

Visualization: ggplot2, plotly, ggiraph.

Code snippets include fetching ACS data, processing it, and building Bayesian models to analyze SNAP participation rates.
